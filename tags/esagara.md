Wooden clogs worn exclusively by women and girls with prongs like Japanese geta yet otherwise resembles Holzeshuhe, Klompen, and Sabots. These are usually worn barefoot to account for the hot weather do to climate change.

These were created initially as servant footware during the Franco Japanese wars, but later evolved to be worn by working class women.
