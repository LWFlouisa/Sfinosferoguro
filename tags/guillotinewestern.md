Future westerns specifically set in aftermath of the Franco-Japanese wars in the US, which brought the guillotine over and replaced the hangman's noose. Bandit women wear birkenstocks to their beheadings.

The guillotine is a Japanese modification of the German variation called the Falling Ax, and modified into something like a crossbow. Which was later repurposed into a self-defence weapon.
