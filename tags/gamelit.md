Similar to LitRPG, except that there is considerably less of a focus on statistical gameplay elements, and more on a naturalistc exploration of the game world within the work of fiction. The difference between LitRPG and GameLit is often blurry, and often an internet dispute is over whether something qualifies as truly LitRPG or GameLit.
