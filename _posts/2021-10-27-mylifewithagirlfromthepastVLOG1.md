INT. NUMEROHEX PORTRAIT

  Panel 1. CLOSE UP: NumeroHex leans in close to the viewer of the pod cast.

    NUMEROHEX
    Hello, by the time you see this video know that
    I may be dead. But before I go, I have one last
    confession to make.

EXT. STRASBOURG GRAVEYARD

  Panel 1. A young girl with a blond braid and a
           large bow with an Alsatian dress and
           wooden shoes, is walking through the
           forest visiting her family at the campfire.

  Panel 2. She had was holding some ground
           almonds she had received through a
           shady deal with a witch in Strasbourg.

    NUMEROHEX
    Sometimes one canâ€™t help meeting
    the love of their life in unusual
    circumstances.

    NUMEROHEX
    For this girl, she had lived in the
    previous century.

  EXTREME CLOSE UP: NumeroHex leans in closer to the viewer.

    NUMEROHEX
    I started researching into Anna-Marie
    Boeglin. A French serial murderess who
    murdered her two brothers and father.

    NUMEROHEX
    When I had finished my graphic novel
    I was working on, I thought it would be the
    end of my tale.

    NUMEROHEX
    But I have been seeing strange things
    that indicates that she had not died after
    all after I had finished this book.

INT. LIVING ROOM

   Panel 1. NumeroHex is sitting on the couch, and finds
   a dark blow folded bow resting on the couch.

    NUMEROHEX
    At first I thought I had just forgotten
    that I had made such, do to a lapse
    in memory.

INT. NUMEROHEX PORTRAIT

  Panel 1. NumeroHex is sleeping on her Japanese style
  futon, while trying to listen to a pod cast.

    NUMEROHEX
    But at night I would see visions of a white
    haired woman in a black robe, holding a bag
    of almonds.

    NUMEROHEX
    But upon closer inspection there was nobody
    there in the mirror. And only I would hear the
    cackling in my room.

  Panel 2. NumeroHex shifted and found a midnight
  blue folded bow beside her on her Japanese
  futon.

    NUMEROHEX
    What do you want from me?

    DARK HOODED WITCH
    I would like to make a deal with you,
    and you may know a girl whom I had
    made a deal with before. I can give you
    your greatest desire.

    NUMEROHEX
    ( I assumed that it was just a dream. )
    Can you bring into the world Anna-Marie
    Boeglin?

    DARK HOODED WITCH
    Yes, but in exchange--

    NUMEROHEX
    I had forgotten what had happened in
    the rest of the dream. But after that, I had
    started seeing a strange figure in the forest.

    Also I feel like I met that face before, right
    when I had visited the beach last month.
