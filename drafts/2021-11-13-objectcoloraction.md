From Ruby to SenSpace, there was a transition period. She started viewing her AI projects like static website generators: there would be required folders marked with an underscore, that would deliver important files from a server located on her own computer. These would offer both plain text files and ruby modules that she needed to operate the script. Together they would form a project that was never always directly on her machine, in order to keep the overall file size that was on her computer to a minimum.

Senspace was a higher level scripting language, that could be used to compile from slightly level script, or even to machine code itself. But generally her preference was to use machine code as little as possible, except for when she would have no other option but to do so. Instead she wanted a slightly different syntax from Ruby, which had gotten slightly old do how often she had worked with the language. Languages like C++ continued to be fairly complicated, which was the exact opposite of the direction she was working with.

For Esareta, it was a matter of consternation that most of the prominent thinkers in artificial intelligence would be focusing significantly on the AI ethics portion of that field, when for her there wasn’t even a singular database that the brains of the machine would even be kept. This was because she thought of the mechanics closer to working with individual artificial atoms, atoms that would work together in unison rather than as individual forms of artificial intelligence.

Her original project was codename Imp Unit, that was more like a traditional computer viruses domesticated into something harmless. The primary mechanism would be a hidden seed script that would download dependencies from a repository on her own computer, which would include things like AIML, or artificial intelligence markup language: a method of producing chat bots. Usually the form this would take would be a chat bot for a website, but she used it more like how programmers use the Chat-script language.

The hardest part of programming was getting used to the new syntax of SenSpace, replacing module with mojuru, along with other keyword name changes. She had developed the mindset that for whatever more complicated things she needed to develop, he would have to build a text parser from the ground up, in order to avoid leaking trade secrets out to the web. SenSpace in and of itself is an free and open source language, but for it was the prototype of other kinds of text parsers that would have more complexity.

Today she worked on a different text parser, which is a scaled down version of the Fraponic constructed language, a fusion of French and Japanese that had shifted into its own language family after 2085. This would be split into four separate tokens: gender object color action. Gender would mark the gender of the object, the gender of the color, and the gender of the action. There was not a computing context where would would need to separate between masculine, feminine, and neutral. However when she needed to develop TTS spoken word commands for her chat bot, it would important for linguistic reasons to know these distinctions.

However the computer was something different, unless you would engineering artificial world systems, or some form of virtual reality. But to navigate in the computer there wasn’t anything split between gender categories, but theoretically there would be objects, colors of said objects, and what to do with said object with a specific color. The most common example being a file folder with a specific color. You could even get more specific by making the distinction between the [ object color action ] of the folder itself, and the [ object color action ] that was the file contained in said folder.

Ultimately she needed less complicated ways of developed software, because once a file size became so big, it became increasingly difficult to debug, with some ruby scripts getting to be as large as thousands of lines of code: this was the original reason she started bundling them together into Ruby gems.

Increasingly she wanted to keep some software prototypes for herself, and was concerned by the hyper partisan direction that politics has gone with excess “wokeness”, which meant even if she meant well, there would be at least someone on social media that would make a rude comment on why she didn’t include other pronouns beyond simply masculine, feminine, and neutral terms. But this was purely a linguistic technically confined purely in the world of meat, where things took on a physical shape.

But it made no difference on a laptop, on the net, where someone can pretend to be a desktop folder, or make some other ridiculous claim. They say this has to do with ending capitalism, but it was curious that old style communist revolutionaries never worried about such minutia, and in the case of the Soviet Union, long before the Franco-Japanese wars in the US, they were some of the most anti-identity politics and political correctness people there ever was.

Although to keep the peace, she chose instead to barely speak on social media. It wasn’t worth the hassle, and who knows what things they would claiming now on the net, as there never seemed to be a limit to how many genders someone could claim to be, sometimes even claiming to be another species when there was biological inaccurate at best, and sometimes intellectually dishonest.

But identity issues was a passing fad, and one that an increasing amount of Strasserite progressives were getting tired of.

At this point however, she dropped out of conversations.

It simply wasn’t worth the stress.
